    "Taking derivatives with respect to functions or parameters is one of the most common and fundamental operations that we will need for Machine Learning (and in fact for Scientific Computing, in general). Throughout your life so far, you have probably learned about three main ways to compute derivatives:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Analytical Differentiation**: computing the analytical derivative manually using the rules of calculus and pencil and paper. The benefit of this approach is that it is exact, but the drawback is that it can be tedious, manual, and error-prone for complex functions. Once completed, we get a function that has the exact derivative everywhere.\n",
    "2. **Symbolic Differentiation**: using a computer algebra system (CAS) to compute the analytical derivative symbolically. The main benefit of this approach is that it is exact and can handle more complex functions than manual differentiation, but the drawback is that it can be slow and may produce very complicated expressions that are difficult to evaluate numerically (a phenomenon known as *expression swell*). This method also produces a function that has the exact derivative everywhere as a single (often very large) function.\n",
    "3. **Numerical Differentiation**: using finite difference approximations to compute the derivative numerically, for example using the formula $\\frac{df}{dx} \\approx \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$ for some small $h$. The main benefit of this approach is that it is easy to implement and can handle any function that can be evaluated numerically, but its drawbacks are that it only approximates the derivative, can be sensitive to the choice of $h$, suffers from numerical precision issues, and only provides the derivative at a single evaluated point (unlike analytical or symbolic approaches that produce a function of the derivative that is valid everywhere).\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter won't cover those approaches in detail, as its main goal is to introduce you to a fourth way to compute derivatives called *Automatic Differentiation* (AD). This approach inherits some of the benefits of analytical and symbolic differentiation, in that it computes *exact* derivatives (unlike numerical differentiation). It's main drawback is that the effort used to compute the derivatives will be only useful for a single evaluation point (similar to numerical differentiation). Unlike symbolic differentiation, AD is very efficient and does not suffer from expression swell, although it does require extra bookkeeping to keep track of intermediate values and derivatives (as we will see), which can add some memory and computational overhead.\n",

    "\n",
    "With this overview in mind, we can now introduce Automatic Differentiation using a simple example, and then later demonstrate how to use it via some practical examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Automatic Differentiation\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate how Automatic Differentiation works, let's take a simple example function, for which we can easily compute the derivatives manually/analytically, so that we can check out results. Let's consider the function: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x_1, x_2) = \\ln(x_1) + x_1 \\cdot x_2 - \\sin(x_2)\n",

    "\n",
    "evaluated at $x_1 = 2, x_2 = 5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analytically, this function is simple enough that we could actually compute the partial derivatives manually:\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_0} = \\frac{1}{x_0} + x_1 = 0.5 + 5 = 5.5$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_1} = x_0 - cos(x_1) = 2 - 0.284 = 1.716$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for the sake of this example, we will use Automatic Differentiation to compute these derivatives instead. The first step of Automatic Differentiation is to build up a *Computational Graph* of the function using a library of easy to compute derivatives (e.g., $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} x^n \\rightarrow n\\cdot x^{n-1}$)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Build the Computational Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "To build the computational graph, we break the function down into its elementary operations step by step, starting from the beginning (i.e., the inputs to the function). We will introduce intermediate variables ($V_\\#$) to represent the outputs of these intermediate operations. Let's define:\n",

    "Great, this matches what we would expect. At this point, we have just evaluated the function forward, and we don't yet have any derivatives. From here, things get interesting and bifurcate into two main types of Automatic Differentiation: Forward Mode AD and Backward Mode AD. Each of these has important but different uses for reasons that will become clear as we work through the example. Let's start with Forward Mode AD. In both cases, we will start with the initial work we already did with the forward pass above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computing Forward Mode AD (tangent propagation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Forward Mode AD allows us to compute *directional derivatives* of the function, as well as that same directional derivative at *any intermediate node* in the computational graph. This is useful for computing derivatives of functions that have a small number of inputs (e.g., 1-10), but potentially a large number of outputs that we might be interested in. For example, if we were computing a trajectory of a dynamical system, we might want to know how the final state of the system changes with respect to some initial condition. In this case, the initial condition is the input, and the final state is the output. There might be many intermediate states along the way that we also want to know how they change with respect to the initial condition, such as the state or total energy at each time step. Forward Mode AD allows us to compute all of these derivatives in only a single pass through the computational graph.\n",

    "OK, great, we see that with some bookkeeping, we have correctly computed the derivatives of the function with respect to each input variable. Note that we had to do two passes through the computational graph to get both derivatives, since they were different directional derivatives. If we had a third input variable, we would need a third pass, and so on. This is why Forward Mode AD is best suited for functions with a small number of inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the flip side, if we were interested in the derivative of some intermediate node in the computational graph with respect to an input variable, we would have that information available as well. For example, if we wanted to know how $V3$ changes with respect to $x_1$, we can see from the table above that $\\frac{\\partial V3}{\\partial x_1} = 5$. We got this in the process of computing the final function, so this derivative comes \"along for the ride\" without additional cost on our part. This is a powerful feature of Forward Mode AD that we will see is not available in Backward Mode AD: we can get a specific directional derivatives of any intermediate node from the computational graph via the same Forward Mode pass, but the cost of this scales with the number of input variables or number of directional derivatives we want to compute.\n",

    "\n",
    "While Forward Mode AD efficiently found directional derivatives, if we wanted to compute the full gradient of the output with respect to all of the input variables, we would need to do a separate pass for each input variable. This means that the cost of computing the full gradient scales with the number of input variables. If we have a function with a large number of input variables (e.g., 1000s or more), this can be very expensive. To address this, we can use Reverse Mode AD, which will allow us to compute the full gradient of every input variable to a function using a single \"backward pass\" through the computational graph. This is particularly useful for functions that have a small number of outputs (e.g., 1-10), but a very large number of inputs, such as a Neural Network in Machine Learning or mesh coordinates in a Finite Element or Computational Fluid Dynamics simulation.\n",

We will use the notation $\\bar{V} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial V}$, where $f$ is the final output of the function. The adjoint represents how much a small change in that intermediate node would affect the final output of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly to Forward Mode AD, we will have to pick a specific output that we wish to compute the gradient with respect to. In this case, since we are computing the gradient of the output with respect to all input variables, we can set the final output node with a value of 1, i.e., $\\bar{V6} = 1$. From there, we will propagate each adjoint backward through the computational graph using the chain rule.\n",
